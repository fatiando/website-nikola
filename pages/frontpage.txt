Fatiando a Terra (Portuguese for *Slicing the Earth*)
is an open-source `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ toolkit
for **geophysical modeling and inversion**. 

Fatiando provides:

* A way to **integrate geophysical modeling**: functions operate on a common 
  data and model format so that different methods can be interchanged and linked 
  together
* Easily **prototyping inversion** methods using the `fatiando.inversion 
  <http://fatiando.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/inversion.html>`_ package
  of inverse problem solvers
* A range of **toy problems** to help teach modeling and inverse problem
  concepts
* Easy **plotting** with `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ and 
  3D plotting with `Mayavi <http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/>`_
* **Fast** routines, courtesy of `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
  and `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_
* A free (as in beer) and **open-source** alternative
  to commercial software
