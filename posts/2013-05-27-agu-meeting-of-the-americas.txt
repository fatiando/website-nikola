A couple of weeks ago
I was at the 
`2013 AGU Meeting of the Americas <http://moa.agu.org/2013/>`_
in Cancun, Mexico.
The meeting felt kind of empty
and almost every session
had a talk withdrawn.
Still, I greatly enjoyed 
the ones that were presented,
specially the seismology sessions!
It was a chance
to see old friends from 
the `University of SÃ£o Paulo <http://www.iag.usp.br/>`_
and get an update on 
what they are up to.
Plus, it was in Cancun...

This was my second Meeting of the Americas.
The first one was in 2010,
here in Brazil,
and I presented my work on 
the `Tesseroids <http://leouieda.github.io/tesseroids>`_ software
(`slides on figshare <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.156858>`_),
which has been 
`integrated into Fatiando 
<2013-02-21-tesseroid-calculations-in-fatiando.html>`_.
This year, 
I gave an oral presentation
entitled "3D magnetic inversion by planting anomalous densities".
Now, for the geophysicists among you,
this might seem like a really odd title.
How can you invert
a magnetic anomaly
using densities?
Well, you can't.
That was a typo in the title
that nobody seemed to catch!
Not me, my adviser, or the referees.
So the correct title should be
"3D magnetic inversion by planting anomalous **magnetization**".
Sorry about that...


Anyway, this talk was about 
a new 3D magnetic inversion method.
This is an adaptation of the 
`inversion method <http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/geo2011-0388.1>`_
that I developed for
my Master's degree
(`pdf <http://fatiando.org/papers/Uieda,Barbosa_2012(2).pdf>`_),
which is implemented in 
the `fatiando.gravmag.harvester 
<http://fatiando.readthedocs.org/en/Version0.1/api/gravmag.harvester.html>`_
module.
I have been improving this method
since the start of my PhD
(see 
`this SEG abstract <http://fatiando.org/papers/Uieda,Barbosa_2012(3).pdf>`_)
and this presentation contains
the latest developments.
The code hasn't been merged 
into the main Fatiando
`development branch <https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando/tree/devel>`_ yet 
but it should be available 
in the 0.2 release.

As always, 
the slides are 
`on figshare <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.703651>`_.
While we wait for 
the embed functionality
in figshare, 
I'll have to make do
with Slideshare:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="float:center;">
    <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21222698" 
    width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" 
    scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" 
    allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>
    </div>

I'll make the code and data
needed to reproduce these results
available once the paper has been submitted.

Now I'll go prepare for 
`Scipy 2013 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/>`_!
