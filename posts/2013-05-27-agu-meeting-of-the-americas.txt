A couple of weeks ago
I was at the 
`2013 AGU Meeting of the Americas <http://moa.agu.org/2013/>`_
in Cancun, Mexico.
The meeting felt kind of empty
and almost every session
had a talk withdrawn.
Still, I greatly enjoyed 
the ones that were presented,
specially the seismology sessions!
It was a chance
to see old friends from 
the `University of SÃ£o Paulo <http://www.iag.usp.br/>`_
and get an update on 
what they are up to.
Plus, it was in Cancun...

This was my second Meeting of the Americas.
The first one was in 2010,
here in Brazil,
and I presented my work on 
the `Tesseroids <http://leouieda.github.io/tesseroids>`_ software
(`slides on figshare <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.156858>`_),
which has been 
`integrated into Fatiando 
<2013-02-21-tesseroid-calculations-in-fatiando.html>`_.
This year, 
I gave an oral presentation
entitled "3D magnetic inversion by planting anomalous densities".
Now, for the geophysicists among you,
this might seem like a really odd title.
How can you invert
a magnetic anomaly
using densities?
Well, you can't.
That was a typo in the title
that nobody seemed to catch!
Not me, my adviser, or the referees.
So the correct title should be
"3D magnetic inversion by planting anomalous **magnetization**".
Sorry about that...

Anyway, this talk was about 
a new 3D magnetic inversion method.
This is an adaptation of the 
`inversion method <http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/geo2011-0388.1>`_
that I developed for
my Master's degree
(`pdf <http://fatiando.org/papers/Uieda,Barbosa_2012(2).pdf>`_),
which is implemented in 
the `fatiando.gravmag.harvester 
<http://fatiando.readthedocs.org/en/Version0.1/api/gravmag.harvester.html>`_
module.
I have been improving this method
since the start of my PhD
(see 
`this SEG abstract <http://fatiando.org/papers/Uieda,Barbosa_2012(3).pdf>`_)
and this presentation contains
the latest developments.
The code hasn't been merged 
into the main Fatiando
`development branch <https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando/tree/devel>`_ yet 
but it should be available 
in the 0.2 release.

As always, 
the slides are 
`on figshare <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.703651>`_.
While we wait for 
the embed functionality
in figshare, 
I'll have to make do
with Slideshare:

    allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>
    </div>

I'll make the code and data
needed to reproduce these results
available once the paper has been submitted.

Now I'll go prepare for 
`Scipy 2013 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/>`_!

**UPDATE 28-05-2013**

For convinience,
I'll reproduce here the abstract:

We present a new
3D magnetic inversion algorithm
based on 
the computationally efficient method
of planting anomalous densities.
The algorithm consists
of an iterative growth
of the anomalous bodies
around prismatic elements 
called "seeds".
These seeds are user-specified
and have known magnetizations.
Thus, 
the seeds provide 
a way for the interpreter
to specify the desired skeleton
of the anomalous bodies.
The inversion algorithm
is computationally efficient 
due to various optimizations
made possible by 
the iterative nature
of the growth process.
The control provided 
by the use of seeds
allows one 
to test different hypothesis
about the geometry
and magnetization
of targeted anomalous bodies.
To demonstrate this capability,
we applied our inversion method
to the Morro do Engenho (ME)
and A2 magnetic anomalies, central Brazil 
(Figure 1a).
ME is an outcropping alkaline intrusion
formed by dunites, peridotites and pyroxenites
with known magnetization.
A2 is a magnetic anomaly 
to the Northeast of ME
and is thought to be
a similar intrusion
that is not outcropping.
Therefore,
a plausible hypothesis 
is that A2 has 
the same magnetization
as ME.
We tested this hypothesis
by performing an inversion
using a single seed 
for each body.
Both seeds had 
the same magnetization.
Figure 1b shows that
the inversion produced
residuals up to 2000 nT
over A2
(i.e., a poor fit)
and less than 400 nT
over ME
(i.e., an acceptable fit).
Figure 1c shows that
ME is a compact outcropping body
with bottom at 
approximately 5 km,
which is in agreement
with previous interpretations.
However,
the estimate produced 
by the inversion
for A2 is outcropping
and is not compact.
In summary, 
the estimate for A2
provides a poor fit 
to the observations
and is not in accordance
with the geologic information.
This leads to the conclusion
that A2 does not have
the same magnetization as ME.
These results
indicate the usefulness
and capabilities
of the inversion method
here proposed.
