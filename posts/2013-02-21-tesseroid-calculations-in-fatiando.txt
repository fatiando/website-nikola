One of the open-source software projects
I have been working on
is called `Tesseroids <http://leouieda.github.com/tesseroids>`_.

It is a collection of C programs
that calculate the gravitational fields
(e.g., gravitational potential, gravity anomaly, gradient tensor)
of a 
`tesseroid 
<http://tesseroids.readthedocs.org/en/latest/theory.html#what-is-a-tesseroid-anyway>`_.
This is all done in spherical coordinates
and can be used to model large regions
where one would like
to take the Earth's curvature
into consideration.

I'm proud of this software
because it was my first 
real programming project.
I've been working on it
since my 
`undergrad years 
<http://www.mendeley.com/research/c%C3%A1lculo-tensor-gradiente-gravim%C3%A9trico-utilizando-tesser%C3%B3ides/>`_
and it has gone through 
several refactorings.
The main problem with it, though,
is that it is written in C.
So it is very time consuming and tedious
to add new features to it.
One of the things that has been
on my TODO list for quite some time
is exporting to `VTK <http://www.vtk.org/>`_.
This would enable 3D plotting with
`Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_
or `Mayavi <http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/>`_.
Another is adding parallel computations,
which would be a pain to do in a portable way in C.
But I never got around to actually start any of this.
Specially with my PhD in the way
and the much more pleasent experience
of programming in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ on
`Fatiando a Terra <https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando>`_.

So last week I finally got around
to implementing tesseroid calculations and 3D plotting
on Fatiando! 
You can check out the source code on the 
`devel branch on GitHub <https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando/tree/devel>`_.
Here is a little taste 
of a 2 tesseroid model
and the resulting gravitational fields:

There are 2 scripts on the 
`cookbook <https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando/tree/devel/cookbook>`_
that demonstrate the usage.
One even shows how to split a large model
and calculate in parallel using the
`multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
package.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/leouieda/5006822.js"></script>

This script generates a 40000 tesseroid model
of the crust,
plots it in Mayavi,
calculates the gravity anomaly
and plots that using a 
`orthographic projection <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/ortho.html>`_
(using the `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
`Basemap toolkit <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`_).

It's that easy!
