For a while now we've been thinking of opening up the <em>fatiando.org</em> domain to more than just the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> package <a title="Fatiando a Terra" href="http://fatiando.org/projects/">fatiando</a>.The idea was to include some other  open-source content, like <a title="Software" href="http://fatiando.org/projects/">other software</a> for geophysics, <a title="Content" href="http://fatiando.org/projects/">lecture notes</a>, slides, etc. All free and open source!
</p>

<p>
Last week, I decided to take the time to make these changes. I've made a lot of changes to the site (including a trying out a new <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> theme) to make it fit this new direction to the <em>Fatiando a Terra</em> project. We'll try to make the blog a place for discussion about new publications, crazy ideas, and the like. I'll be taking some baby steps toward this goal and see how things go from there.
</p>

<p>
I included under the Fatiando umbrella my other open-source project <a title="Tesseroids" href="http://leouieda.github.com/tesseroids">Tesseroids</a>, a software package for gravity modeling in spherical coordinates! The programs are command line and written in C. There is documentation (on <a href="http://tesseroids.readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDocs</a>) complete with instructions, theory, and even a cookbook! Version 1.1 of Tesseroids will be out soon and I'm working on a paper describing the software and some new things we've discovered using it. There will be a blog post about this once the paper is out (I promise)!

<p>
Our megalomaniac goal is still to model the whole Earth, but now the site might be useful to more people. Check it out and let us know what you think!
