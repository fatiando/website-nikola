Fatiando a Terra (Portuguese for *Slicing the Earth*)
is an **open-source** toolkit
for geophysical modeling and inversion.

In a wider scope,
we also aim
to be an open repository
for geophysics.

We provide a home for:

* Open-source software
* Lecture notes and exercises (free under Creative Commons licenses)
* A blog for discussion of ideas, recent publications, programming, etc


What we have so far
===============================

The *Fatiando a Terra* software package
is under development
on `GitHub <https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando>`_.
