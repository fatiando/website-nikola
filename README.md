# Fatiando a Terra

Source code for the website http://fatiando.org

Made using [Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar), a static site generator.

Code to generate the site is on the *master* branch.
Use `make build` to generate the html for the site and
`make show` to open it in Firefox.

For now, a copy of the generated html site 
is in the *gh-pages* branch. 
This way it is served by GitHub Pages at http://leouieda.github.com/fatiando.org
